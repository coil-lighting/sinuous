Notes on enttec analysis

Testing conditions:

port parameters:
set fps: 10
set break: 9
set MAB: 1

software parameters:
rising pattern, 10 dmx vals per step, 200 ms sleep between steps

measurements:
100 ms rep rate
mark between packets: 56.64 ms
break: 192.375 us
MAB: 12.45 us
11 bits in 85 us:
4 us per bit
~41 us mark after slot (interesting)

measured sequence:

looks good

port parameters:

software parameters:
rising pattern, 1 dmx vals per step, 50 ms sleep between steps

measurements:
100 ms rep rate
mark between packets: 56.7 ms

MAB: 12.3 us
~40 us mark after slot

sensible.  the port has a one-packet buffer.  it sends out whatever it has on its frame clock.
sending a packet to the port is asynchronous.

"stopping" the port doesn't actually stop sending DMX packets.  any way we can override this behavior?
when the port is first plugged in it is not transmitting.
the port is still not transmitting when the "start()" method is called.


ok time to push the limits.
we must send at least 24 (25?) channels at maximum speed to satisfy the minimum time between breaks of 1204 us.

port parameters:

set fps: 40
set break: 9
set MAB: 1

software parameters:
rising pattern, 1 dmx value per step, 25 ms sleep between steps

measurements:
25.08 ms rep rate
mark between packets: 13.58 ms
break: 192.5 us
MAB: 12.62 us
no mark after slot
44 us to send 11 bits

measured sequence:

cool


MAXIMUM SPEED!!!

port parameters:

set fps: 0
set break: 9
set MAB: 1

software parameters:
rising pattern, 1 dmx val per step, 5 ms sleep between steps

measurements:
11.5 ms rep rate
mark between packets: none
break: 191.7 us
MAB: 12.45 us
no mark after slot
44 us to send 11 bits

measured sequence:
73
75
75/76 (75 in slot 135, 76 in slot 136)
77/78 (split at 121/122)
79/80/81 (split at 84/85, 243/244)

wow.  it looks like in this mode it allows the buffer to change during write.

checking this in 40 fps mode: this happens with 5 ms refresh here as well.

it looks like writing to the buffer and sending the buffer happen simultaneously.


checking reduced universe size:

25 channels, 40 fps: sends just fine
3 channels, 40 fps: sends 24 channels with padding added, as expected
0 channels, 40 fps: no error, sends 24 zero-padded channels
25 channels, 0 fps: seems fine:

measurements:
1.348 ms rep rate
mark betwen packets: none
break: 191.7 us
MAB: 12.45 us
no mark after slot
44 us to send 11 bits


25 channels, 0 fps: strobing with 11 ms software timing is fucking amazing on colorblast OG.
this colorblast seems to be meeting the full tightness of the DMX spec.
strobing achieved at 90.9 Hz if it is really responding at 11 ms intervals.
very qualitatively different than 22 ms refresh rate
incredible.
